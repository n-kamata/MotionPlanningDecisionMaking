# SDC Planning Results
This project is based on [nd013-c5-planning-starter](https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c5-planning-starter).

These files in this project are extracted from [this directory](https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c5-planning-starter/tree/master/project/starter_files) and modified to navigate a self-driving vehicle in a simulator, called Carla.

Simulation results are following.

The self-driving car can choose a trajectory that did not collide and avoid to the left.

The self-driving car can choose a trajectory that did not collide with less steering wheel angle and avoid to the right.

The self-driving car can eventually avoid last car and return to its original lane.
